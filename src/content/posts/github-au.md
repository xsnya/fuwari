# 前言：
在`2025-08-09`，我正在本账户上创建一个*组织*，当我刚要邀请其他人的时候突然，我的Github账号访问出现了404！

# 如何解决的？
我是依照`CSDN`上的教程解决的。

Dear GitHub Support Team,

I am writing regarding the suspension of my GitHub account (username: tb-miao)which displays the message:
“Access to your account has been suspended due to a violation of our Terms of Service.”

As an open-source enthusiast and a professional who heavily relies on GitHub for my daily work, I am deeply concerned about this situation.     However, I am unaware of the specific violation that led to the suspension.
I submitted a ticket in confusion, then I tried to reset my password again.     Then I was able to reset it and login again.     Weirdest account experience I've ever had.     Should I just wait for a response to the ticket to explain what just happened or submit another one?     I don't want to be suddenly locked out of here because I have group projects to work on.
```
